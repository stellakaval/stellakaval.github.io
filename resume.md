### Projects
- **Attax (Java) 🎮**: Attax is a strategy-based, two-player board game implemented on a 7x7 grid. Players control red and blue pieces, aiming to convert their opponent’s pieces by strategic placement and movement.
- **Deque (Java) 🔄**: Deque is a data structure project where both linked list and array implementations of a Double Ended Queue (Deque) are built, allowing insertion and removal of elements from both ends.
- **Enigma (Java) 🔐**: Enigma simulates the historical Enigma machine used during World War II. The project involves building a Java program that can encode and decode messages based on customizable rotors and plugboard settings.
- **Gitlet (Java) 🌱**: Gitlet is a simplified version of Git, implemented in Java. It supports essential version control features such as committing changes, branching, merging, and restoring previous file versions.
- **2048 (Java) 🎲**: In this project, the core logic for the popular sliding-tile puzzle game 2048 is implemented. The goal is to combine numbered tiles on a grid to create a tile with the number 2048.
- **Wordnet (Java) 📚**: Wordnet explores the relationships between words, particularly focusing on is-a (hypernym-hyponym) relationships. It also involves analyzing the frequency and usage patterns of words in printed English works.
- **Ants vs. Bees (Python) 🐜🐝**: Ants vs. Bees is a strategy-based game similar to Plants vs. Zombies, where players control ants to defend their colony from invading bees. The project focuses on game design, AI for enemies, and player strategies.
- **Cats (Python) 🐱**: Cats is a project that measures typing speed and accuracy. It involves creating a program that tests how quickly and correctly users can type, with additional features for correcting typing errors.
- **Memory Safety (Python) 🛡️**: Memory Safety involves identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in programs running on a virtual machine. The project emphasizes understanding and mitigating security risks related to memory management.
- **Scheme Interpreter (Python) 🧠**: Scheme Interpreter is a project where a subset of the Scheme programming language is implemented. The project involves parsing, evaluating expressions, and managing memory for the interpreter.
- **Spam vs. Ham (Python) 📧**: Spam vs. Ham is a machine learning project focused on classifying emails as spam or legitimate (ham). The goal is to build a classifier that can accurately distinguish between the two based on text content.
- **CS61kaChow (NumC) (C) 🧮**: CS61kaChow (NumC) is a project where matrix operations, inspired by Python’s numpy library, are implemented in C. The focus is on efficient manipulation and computation of large matrices.
- **Snek (C) 🐍**: Snek is a classic snake game implemented in C. The project involves handling user input, managing the snake’s movement, and implementing game mechanics such as collision detection and scoring.
- **File Sharing (Go) 🔗**: File Sharing is a secure file-sharing program written in Go. The project emphasizes ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of shared data through encryption and secure protocols.
- **CS61CPU (Logisim) 💻**: CS61CPU is a project that simulates a Central Processing Unit (CPU) using Logisim. The project focuses on understanding the fundamental operations of a CPU and building a functional model from scratch.
