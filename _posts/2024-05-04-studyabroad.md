### Lund University

"Hej!" – or hi in Swedish. For my spring semester abroad, I have been immersed in student life at Lund University in Lund, Sweden. Nestled in the southern part of the country, it is a quick one-hour train ride from Copenhagen, Denmark. Lund, known as a "studentenstad" by the Swedes, is alive with student activity. As you stroll along the quaint cobblestone streets, you'll encounter countless biking enthusiasts eagerly cycling to their next destination, long lines at the local ice cream spot, and the stunning cathedral standing proudly at the heart of the city.

With my Swedish roots, the excitement of learning more about my heritage drew me to the program. After researching Lund's renowned engineering program and legendary student scene, I knew it was the place to spend my semester abroad! Fast forward to today, and I'm thrilled to share some of the Swedish university traditions I've discovered along the way.

### Student Nations

Blekingska, Göteborgs, Hallands, Helsingkrona, Kalmar, Kristianstads, Lunds Malmö, Smålands, Sydskånska, Västgöta, Wermlands, Östgöta – to an outsider, these might all sound like Swedish cities, but to a Lund student, they're the beating heart of student life and community on campus.

At Lund University, student nations are not just clubs. They are welcoming social hubs each with their own vibe and trademark events. Named after regions in Sweden, these nations once exclusively welcomed students from their respective areas. Now, they're welcome for any student to join! From cozy soup lunches to spirited volleyball tournaments, themed club nights, elegant balls, and even delicious American brunches, nation events can turn any day of the week into a fun social gathering. What's unique is that they're all organized and run entirely by students.

One of my most memorable experiences was volunteering at Västgöta nation's kitchen. From flipping 200 pancakes to baking a traditional Swedish kladdkaka, it was a fun crash course in Swedish culture and tradition. What made it even better was the friendliness of fellow Swedish volunteers, who made it a social experience to remember.

While students can only choose to be a member of one nation, all events are open to everyone, creating an inclusive environment that was ideal for an exchange student like me.

### Sittnings

Imagine stepping into a grand ballroom, filled with lively chatter and laughter. Candles cast a warm glow as students mingle, dressed in their finest attire. This is a typical sittning, a cherished tradition in Swedish university social life.

Sittnings are special dinner parties that are a common part of student life in Sweden, hosted for various reasons by academic departments or student nations. Some are laid-back, like pajama-themed nights, while others are glamorous affairs, with cocktail dresses and heels.

The sittning atmosphere is snug and cozy, reminiscent of the Oscars. A three-course meal is served, with dessert always a favorite. And a fun fact: at fancier sittnings, you're only allowed to leave your seat between courses, waiting for the green light.

"Skal!" – or a toast. A key part of a sittning is toasts. Every Lund student has a songbook filled with quirky tunes and heartfelt messages, and passing it around for signatures is a rite of passage. Trust me, you haven't experienced Swedish culture until you've belted out tunes like "Helan går" or "Jesus lever" at a sittning!

I've had the opportunity to attend several sittnings during my time here, each offering its own distinct charm. Whether it was Göteborgs nation's new student finsittning, Västgöta's tacksittning for volunteers, or Östgöta's engineering student sittning, each occasion left a lasting memory, deepening my appreciation for Swedish customs and community spirit.

### Valborg 

Valborg is like the Super Bowl of Lund, marking the beginning of spring in Sweden. For context, Lund is freezing cold in the winter, so when the sun finally emerges, Swedes become sun worshipers.

Kvalborg, the day before Valborg, kicks things off with a bang. Student nations hold events to amp up excitement for Valborg. My friends and I camped out to score tickets to Västgöta nation's event, and it was one of the best festivals I have attended. With Swedish artists performing, sponsors handing out gifts, and a huge stage setup, we were in for a day and evening of non-stop celebrations. 

Valborg itself happens on the last day of April and is the most important day of the week-long celebration. Every student flocks to Stadsparken, Lund's main city park, for a day of hanging out and celebrating. We arrived bright and early, armed with blankets, snacks, and a portable grill. The park was buzzing with excitement as students claimed their spots for the day-long festivities. We made sure to arrive at 6 am to snag a prime spot away from the porta-potties, and we stayed out all day. Around 4 pm, the city cleared out students to prepare for a massive bonfire—a tradition that occurs in towns throughout Sweden. 

As for May 1st, it's all about the aftermath and celebration of Valborg. We headed to the botanical gardens and enjoyed a relaxed day of recovery and sunshine.

### Tandem

Have you ever heard of a tandem relay race? I definitely hadn't until I got to Lund and discovered it was one of the biggest traditions on campus! Essentially, teams of students decide to race from Gothenburg back to Lund, all on tandem bikes.

So, my friend and I decided to jump in on the action with the Västgöta nation team. We decided to go all out and dressed up as Tiger Kings (thanks Netflix), and off we went on this epic adventure of biking, bussing, and partying our way back to Lund!

Our journey kicked off at 11 am on a Friday. We were playing games, cracking jokes, and just soaking in the vibes with our new Swedish friends on the bus ride up to Gothenburg. When we finally reached Gothenburg, everywhere you looked, there were teams in their crazy costumes, all pumped up and ready to race. Ready…set…go! The tandem kicked off in the center of Gothenburg, bikes zooming to pass each other. Somewhere along the way, we made a pit stop for a rave in Varberg at 2 am. We danced in the middle of the night with a bunch of exhausted but hyped-up students. By the time our turn to cycle came at 3 am, we were pumped and ready to go. We hopped on the tandem bike and pedaled our hearts out to the tune of Espresso by Sabrina Carpenter, covering a solid 13 km stretch from Varberg. It wasn't easy, I'll admit, but having other teams cheering us on kept us going. Eventually, we met up with our teammates, passed the bike to the next two racers, and continued our journey back to Lund.

When we finally rolled back into Lund the next day, we were belting out our newfound favorite Swedish tune, "Tigerjakt." To top it all off, our team received the prize for being the closest to the target finish time!

### Fika

Last but not least: fika. It's like the Swedish version of a coffee break, but way cooler. Imagine cozy cafes, delicious pastries, and good company. It's more than just a break—it's a chance to unwind, connect with friends, and eat some seriously good kanelbullar (cinnamon buns). And one time they asked me to put away my laptop because of their cafe policy so everyone could really savor the fika moment!

### Takeaways

Lund has been a student experience like no other. It's taught me to embrace new cultures, step out of my comfort zone, and make memories that will last a lifetime. So, if you ever find yourself in Scandinavia, don't sleep on Lund. It's worth the visit! Until next time, tack för allt, Lund! (Thanks for everything, Lund!)
