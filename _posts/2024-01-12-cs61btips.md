As a soon-to-graduate senior and four-semester veteran TA of UC Berkeley's CS61B, I've spent more time with data structures than the average human (with stacks of pancakes being my favorite, of course). I've learned that CS61B isn't simply about mastering data structures; it's an academic rollercoaster that pushes your coding skills, problem-solving abilities, and mental resilience to new heights. From my own late-night debugging sessions as a student to guiding others through office hours, I've gathered valuable insights on how to navigate this challenging course successfully. This guide will cover three essential strategies: staying on track, building confidence, and leveraging office hours effectively. Without further ado, let's dive in!

*Note*: I want to preface the post by saying that success in CS61B comes in many different forms depending on your goals. To me, success is not about getting the top grade in the class; it means understanding the material in a way that you can explain it to your friends, feeling like your problem-solving skills are enhanced through interesting projects, and lastly, feeling confident in your ability to go out into the world and code up your own projects. 

### Tip #1: Why Starting Early is Crucial

CS61B is an *extremely fast-paced course*. You might be thinking, “Well, Stella, I’ve taken many other work-intensive courses in high school or college,” but let me tell you, CS61B will change your opinion on what is fast-paced. I would also argue that CS61B is much faster than CS61A or CS88 because of the length of the assignments and the depth of the material. We asked students, “Compared to the average course you’ve taken at Berkeley, how did CS 61B’s workload compare?” and 83% said more. (FA24 End of Semester Survey)

**The first time management challenge presents itself in the very first week of the course: learning Java.** Java is a very verbose and complex programming language you probably haven’t seen before. The class’s pace expects you to become fluent in the language within 1 to 2 weeks, which is very little time. *It is important in this stage to really hone in on your Java skills because they will be the foundation of everything you do.* This might mean taking additional time outside of class to watch YouTube videos, do introductory problems, or ask for help during office hours. It might even be helpful to make a cheat sheet for yourself on helpful Java commands and their corresponding syntax in Python. *Tip*: I also have all my helpful materials posted on the teaching tab of this site you’re welcome to check out!


**The second time management challenge will come with projects.**  The majority of students are spending 7-20+ hours on each project, with more on the later projects. (FA24 End of Semester Survey) What does this mean? *Start as early as possible on them!* As a student, I remember when I took 61B, the day the project was released I would spend 2 hours just reading the spec and getting set up so I could come in immediately the next day to office hours to ask questions about anything confusing. One of the biggest painpoint projects for students is Project 0, which is released very early on in the course. And let me tell you, Project 0 is no “Level 0” or joke. It is a full-length project and can take up to 15+ hours to complete. Since this project rolls around so quickly, it’s easy to put it off or not realize the difficulty and hour commitment it will take. This could lead to a snowball effect of getting extensions and falling behind on all Projects 1-3 throughout the semester. So I would recommend getting started on that ASAP! I will say though that extenuating circumstances always happen; maybe you get sick for a week or have a family emergency. The course staff is very understanding of this and grants extensions in those cases.

**The third time management problem will come with falling behind in content.** As I just mentioned, you’re putting all this work into projects, right, so it feels like going to lectures and discussions is just not important anymore. Don’t get caught in this mentality! *I encourage you to really stay on top of the material because it actually is being applied in projects, assignments, homework, and labs.* For me, to be completely transparent, I did not have the energy to go to every lecture taking the course. Sometimes it was easier to just go to a discussion and exam discussion than to go to the real lecture. I also think that’s why as a TA I teach bridge discussion now, and I highly recommend checking it out. It is a 2-hour extended discussion to cover more content and the entire worksheet. Another great content resource is tutor review sessions. They usually happen in weeks leading up to the final and are a great way to get a refresher on the material and
